* **Modeling:** Creation of dimensional models for BI and relational database modeling to ensure data integrity and organization.
* **Visualization:** Creation of impactful charts and informative maps using Python (matplotlib, seaborn), R (ggplot2), QGIS, and kepler.gl, as well as interactive dashboards in Power BI with DAX.
* **Advanced Excel:** Extensive knowledge of Excel for ad hoc analysis and quick visualizations.

**IT Skills:**

* **Programming:** Proficiency in Python (OOP, functional) and experience developing web applications with Flask and Shiny (R).
* **Web:** Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for customization and integration of solutions.
* **Infrastructure:** Familiarity with Docker for creating development and deployment environments, as well as experience with Linux systems (Debian/Ubuntu).
